## Whatsapp using Python

Using this Python Script you can send a message to any contact from your Whatsapp list. The script takes just needs you to open Google Chrome browser and login into Whatsapp Web with the help of your phone.

You just have to provide the Contact's name, message text and how many times do you wish to send the message on whatsapp!

#### Prerequisites

1.  The code I have written is in Python 3, so check if you have Python 3 or not with the help of: 
```
python -V
``` 
  
Incase you don't have python, you can download it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
 
 
2. Python Bindings for Selenium ( Browser Automation software )

```
pip install selenium
```

3. Download Chrome Driver

You need to download Chrome driver from here: [Chrome Driver Downloads](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)

Please check your Google Chrome version available at ```chrome://settings/help``` and select Chrome Driver Version accordingly
For example, currently my Chrome Browser Version is 76.0.3809.132, so I would be downloading the driver with version 76.0.3809.68 from the above Downloads page

If you have any concerns please refer the [Chrome Driver Documentation](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

Chrome Driver is available for Linux, Mac and Windows. Based on your OS, download the appropriate ChromeDriver. **Extract it at a known location because we need the location later** 


4. Google Chrome Browser
If you don't have Google Chrome you can download it from [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

You can also use Chromium Browser(open source version of Chrome Browser)
